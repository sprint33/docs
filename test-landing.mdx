## The NTRPX Method

Social media and YouTube are saturated with influencers and ads promoting the latest supplement fads. Most of these promoters are simply following trends and regurgitating marketing copy.

Meanwhile, the most popular formulations on the market are incomplete, contain seemingly random ingredients, are frequently underdosed (especially proprietary blends), and rely on low-efficacy, unproven, and/or biologically unsustainable ingredients.

This isn't opinion — [we analyzed them all](/ingredient-manual).

The NTRPX Method solves these problems by conducting thorough clinical research and systems engineering to provide biologically-optimized, turn-key supplementation systems that are mission aligned, easy to use, clinically supported, and demonstrably effective.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ntrpx-placeholder.png" alt="All Systems Go product image" />
    </Frame>

    **The Circadian Foundation**

    Three-phase daily supplementation aligned to your biological clock. Boost → Sustain → Recover. Stimulant-free. Works standalone or as the base layer for the complete system.

    *9 capsules/day across 3 doses*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Neuraldrink™" icon="droplet" href="/03-neuraldrink">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ntrpx-placeholder.png" alt="Neuraldrink product image" />
    </Frame>

    **Substrates & Hydration**

    Precision electrolyte and metabolic substrate delivery. Creatine for phosphocreatine reserves. Optimized mineral ratios. Evening formula with magnesium glycinate and glycine for sleep support.

    *2–3 servings/day*
  </Card>

  <Card title="ParaCaffeine™" icon="bolt" href="/04-paracaffeine">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ntrpx-placeholder.png" alt="ParaCaffeine product image" />
    </Frame>

    **Sustainable Stimulation**

    Paraxanthine-based daily stimulation. Shorter half-life than caffeine, higher receptor affinity, reduced anxiety, preserved sleep. The coffee replacement engineered from first principles.

    *2 capsules/morning*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Sprint™" icon="rocket" href="/05-sprint">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/ntrpx-placeholder.png" alt="Sprint product image" />
    </Frame>

    **Maximum Output Mode**

    High-intensity acute performance stack. Caffeine + Alpha-GPC + L-Citrulline + Huperzine A. For exams, presentations, competition day. Not for daily use—1–2× per week maximum.

    *6–7 capsules + powder*
  </Card>

## Go deeper

Short, structured modules that map directly to how we build systems: constraints first, then ingredients, then phase-aware stacks.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Biological Energy" href="/systems/biological-energy" icon="bolt">
    ATP throughput, mitochondria, redox, and substrate availability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Neural Performance" href="/systems/neural-performance" icon="brain">
    Signal fidelity, neurotransmission, focus stability, and cognition under load.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Stress Regulation" href="/systems/allostatic-regulation" icon="heart-pulse">
    Arousal control, HPA-axis dynamics, anxiolysis vs drive, and sleep protection.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Recovery & Adaptation" href="/systems/recovery-adaptation" icon="moon">
    Repair, resilience, training response, and long-horizon performance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These four domains are coupled constraints. If you push one aggressively (e.g., stimulants for throughput), you must manage downstream costs (e.g., sleep, stress load, or signal noise). NTRPX organizes documentation around these couplings to reduce trial-and-error.

- **Start with constraints:** identify what's limiting your performance today.
- **Choose a system:** pick the domain that most directly addresses that constraint.
- **Then go ingredient-level:** validate mechanisms, dosing, and kinetics.
